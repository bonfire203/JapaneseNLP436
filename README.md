In this repo, there is a folder called "AssortmentOfWork". This folder holds 3 Jupyter files and one json folder. These files simple show supplementary work we made for this project.

Outside of that folder exists two files. Kanjify, is the method implementing just the tagger. t5_generate_altered_for_japanese is the model based from Dr. Kennington's code.

Kanjify

This is self contained and only relies on kanji.json. In order to run, press the "Run All" cell. The final cell will allow for user input. Replace the text with your own input.

...Generate...

This is self contained. The dependencies are included at the top so you may download necessary files. Next, are the imports. Simply run down the jupyter notebook to recompile and retrain. The training process is very quick. At the bottom, you can put in your own input by replacing the text variable with your own sentence. It should mostly repeat your input.
